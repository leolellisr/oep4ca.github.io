<p>
  This work aims to integrate established cognitive architectures, including SOAR, CONAIM, and more, within a versatile "plug-and-play" framework. This approach unveils a dynamic cognitive architecture playground, enabling online testing and interaction through a RESTful API. Our proposition sets forth a systematic framework for the evaluation of cognitive architectures, fostering a harmonious coexistence with existing models. Our approach is prepared to address the longstanding limitations and challenges inherent in the implementation and evaluation of cognitive architectures.
